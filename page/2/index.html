<li>  Project approval</li>
<li>  Project plan</li>
<li>  Requirement development</li>
<li>  Design &amp; Achievement</li>
<li>  Test</li>
<li>  Release</li>
<li>  Node term</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>This stage mainly includes <strong>project management</strong> and <strong>project review</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Project management</strong> mainly includes business demand research, market research, technical feasibility study, etc. In this process, <em>Business Demand Research Report</em>, <em>Market Research Report</em>, <em>Technical Feasibility Analysis Report</em> and <em>Project Application Report</em> shall be formed.</p>
<p><strong>Project review</strong> shall organize a formal review of the Project Application Report.</p>
<p>The overall plan of the project includes determining the project scope, life cycle model,work breakdown, estimating project size, workload, schedule, cost, and required resources.</p>
<p>Subordinate plans mainly include configuration management plans, quality assurance plans, measurement and analysis plans, risk management plans, and training plans.</p>
<p><strong>Test phase</strong> When the testing phase is completed, a formal review meeting is held to analyze the test report and results and make a decision on whether the product can be finalized</p>
<p><strong>Release stage</strong> This stage mainly includes activities such as product confirmation (such as product trial operation, customer acceptance testing, etc.), product conversion (for hardware + embedded software products), and official product launch.</p>
<p><strong>Closing phase</strong> This stage mainly includes archiving and confirmation of results, writing project summary reports, enriching project experience and process documents into the organization’s process wealth library, and enriching reusable resources generated in the project into the reusable basic library.</p>
<h2 id="Professional-Quality"><a href="#Professional-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Professional Quality"></a>Professional Quality</h2><ul>
<li>  A document habitGood documentation is an important part of the formal r&amp;d process. As a developer, it is normal to spend 30% of your working time writing technical documentation. As a senior developer and systems analyst, the percentage is much higher. Without documentation, a software system will lack vitality, and will encounter great trouble in future error-checking, upgrade and module reuse.</li>
<li>  Standardized and standardized coding habitsAs a formal software company’s rules, the variable naming of the code, the format of the comment in the code, and even the length of the indentation of the lines in the nest and the number of blank lines between functions are clearly defined. Good writing habits not only help code migration Error correction also facilitates collaboration between different technicians. The code has good readability and is a basic quality for developers.</li>
<li>  Reusable, modular thinkingReusable design, modular thinking is that when developers complete any functional module or function, they must think more, don’t limit themselves to the simple idea of completing the current task, think about whether the module can be separated from this system Whether it can be directly referenced in other systems and application environments by simply modifying the parameters, so that repetitive development work can be greatly avoided.</li>
<li>  Testing HabitsIn a formal software company, a full-time test engineer is indispensable, but it does not mean that with a full-time test engineer, developers can not perform self-tests; software development as a project, a very important feature is problem detection. The sooner it is solved, the lower the cost of solution. Developers carefully test each piece of code and each sub-module after completion, and can try to find and solve some potential problems as early as possible, so that the efficiency of the overall system construction and Maximum reliability is guaranteed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Personal-Quality"><a href="#Personal-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Personal Quality"></a>Personal Quality</h2><ul>
<li>  Requirements understanding ability Developers need to understand the full requirements of a module. Many developers write programs that focus on a single functional requirement. They attribute performance metrics to the hardware, operating system, and development environment, while ignoring the performance considerations of their code.Among the performance requirements, stability, support capability and security are very important. As a developer, it is necessary to evaluate the environment in which the module is operating, the load pressure it will be subjected to, and the possibility of various potential dangers and malicious attacks.</li>
<li>  Ability to learn and summarize Good at learning, for any career, is necessary to move forward, for developers, this kind of demand is even higher.But study also want to find the target, blind pursuit of some superficial, superficial things and nouns, will never have a qualitative improvement.Good at summary, is also a reflection of learning ability, each completion of a research and development task, complete a piece of code, should have a purpose to track the application of the program and user feedback, summary at any time, find their own shortcomings, so that gradually improve, a developer can grow up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Career-Development"><a href="#Career-Development" class="headerlink" title="Career Development"></a>Career Development</h2><ul>
<li>  The First Difficulty： threat from tiger Developers have to face a lot of hungry tigers. For example, leaders seem to be the natural enemies of developers. The most common complaints of developers are what they don’t know about technology, what they don’t get and what they don’t pay. Developers can only face the reality when they encounter such problems.</li>
<li>  The Second Difficulity：Bill’s competition Generally speaking, most of the developers in China eat “youth meal”, and most of them are in the golden age of 24-28 years old. By the age of 30, a lot of young developers will bring you great competitive pressure. Learning ability, salary requirements, life burden, etc. will make you almost never have the courage to start from scratch. As the old Chinese saying goes, “the waves behind the Yangtze River are pushing the waves ahead, and a generation of new people are replacing the old ones”. This historical law is especially obvious and cruel in the software development industry. If a person has been working in personnel development, the inevitable result is to reduce wages and even unemployment.</li>
<li>  The Third Difficulity：Self strength We all know that the most difficult thing for people to overcome is themselves, so self is the biggest obstacle that developers need to overcome. Most developers regard system analysts and project managers as their career goals, but the achievement of these goals requires personal quality, market opportunities and many other conditions. Too many developers just waste their time in the state of high failure and low failure</li>
<li>  Coping with difficulties：Make career planning Quality of system analyst: customer demand analysis ability, system architecture and design ability, module decomposition design ability, project process control ability, project risk assessment ability, etc. Quality of Project Manager: team organization ability, communication and coordination ability, problem-solving ability and good professional ethics. Personal development can only rely on personal learning and efforts of developers.</li>

<li>  Software engineering</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-crisis"><a href="#software-crisis" class="headerlink" title="software crisis"></a>software crisis</h2><p><strong>Three periods in the development of computer software</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Early era (before the mid-1960s) the programming phaseGeneral hardware, special software; The program is small in size, and the writer and user are the same person (in the same group)</li>
<li>  Second generation (mid-1960s - mid-1970s) program system phaseEmergence of “software workshop”, product software; A “personalized” development approach.</li>
<li>  Third generation (after mid-1970s) software engineering phaseSoftware development has become a new engineering discipline - software engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what is a software crisis?</strong></p>
<p>Software crisis refers to a series of serious problems encountered in the development and maintenance of computer software.</p>
<p><strong>two main problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  How to develop software, how to meet the growing demand for software.</li>
<li>  How to maintain an ever-expanding supply of software</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major manifestations of the software crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Inaccurate estimates of software development costs and schedules.</li>
<li>  The user is not satisfied</li>
<li>  Software quality is not high, reliability is poor</li>
<li>  Software is often unmaintainable and errors are difficult to correct.</li>
<li>  Lack of proper documentation</li>
<li>  The software cost accounts for the system total cost proportion to rise year by year</li>
<li>  The speed of software development can not keep pace with that of computers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The cause of the software crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  It’s about the nature of the software itself.</li>
<li>  Software is not easy to maintain</li>
<li>  In the process of software development, more or less adopted the wrong methods and techniques.</li>
<li>  Without a complete and accurate understanding of the user’s needs, I rushed into writing the program.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to eliminate the software crisis?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  Technical measuresUse better software development methods and tools</li>
<li>  The software development of organization and management This is not a mysterious skill of individual labor, but a kind of engineering project which is well organized, tightly managed, coordinated and completed by all kinds of personnel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-engineering"><a href="#software-engineering" class="headerlink" title="software engineering"></a>software engineering</h2><p><strong>What is software engineering?</strong></p>
<p>Software engineering is an engineering subject that guides the development and maintenance of computer software. It adopts the concept, principle, technology and method of engineering to develop and maintain software, which combines the management technology which has been proved to be correct by time test with the best technical method that can be obtained at present. Software engineering is a subject involving the research and application of the principles, methods and tools of software planning, requirement analysis, design, coding, testing and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the software life cycle divided into phases?</strong></p>
<p>One of the common strategies used by human beings in solving complex problems is to break down each problem, that is, to decompose the problem and then solve each sub problem separately. The “life cycle method” adopted in software engineering is to decompose the complex problems of software development and maintenance from the perspective of time. It divides the long life cycle of software into several stages in turn. Each stage has relatively independent tasks, and then gradually complete the tasks of each stage.</p>
<p><strong>How to divide it?</strong></p>
<p>Software life cycle is generally divided into three periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>  software definition (problem definition, feasibility study, requirement analysis)</li>
<li>  software development (overall design, detailed design, coding and unit testing, comprehensive testing)</li>
<li>  software maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics of each stage?</strong></p>

<h2 id="Software-development-process-model"><a href="#Software-development-process-model" class="headerlink" title="Software development process model"></a>Software development process model</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>waterfall model**</strong>advantages**</p>
<ul>
<li><p>  Accepts the work object of the activity from the previous activity as input 。</p>
</li>
<li><p>  What should be done to implement the activity using this input</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Give the output of the activity to the next activity</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Review the implementation of the activity.If its work is confirmed, it will proceed to the next activity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>*disadvantages**</p>
</li>
<li><p>  From the perspective of epistemology, human cognition is a process that is repeated many times and cannot be completed at once. However, the several stages divided in the waterfall model do not reflect the repetitive nature of this cognitive process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  Software development is a knowledge-intensive development activity that requires mutual cooperation to complete, but the waterfall model does not reflect this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prototype model**</strong>advantages**</p>
<ul>
<li><p>  The prototype method is much better than the traditional life cycle method in getting a good definition of requirements. It can deal with fuzzy requirements, and developers and users can fully communicate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype system can be used as a training environment, which is conducive to the synchronization of user training and development, and the development process is also a learning process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype gives the user the opportunity to change the unreasonable final system in mind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>  The prototype can develop a flexible computer system with low risk.</p>
</li>

<li>  Do not use GO TO statement only use a single entry single exit control structure, so that the static structure of the program and its dynamic implementation is more consistent, easy to read and understand.</li>
<li>  The control structure has a definite logical pattern, the writing of program code is limited to a few straightforward ways, so the source program is clear and smooth.</li>
<li>  The clarity and modularity of the program make it possible to reuse the most code when modifying and redesigning a software.</li>

          <h2 id="前言"><a href="#前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言</h2><p>这学期，学校开展了一门android的课，所以不可避免的要安装了Android Studio（下面全部简称AS），但是由于安装的过程中非常的艰难，所以我准备写一篇博客来纪念一下我艰难的安装过程，并帮助一下正在为环境烦恼的同学们。</p>
<h2 id="环境"><a href="#环境" class="headerlink" title="环境"></a>环境</h2><ul>
<li>  操作系统：MAC OS</li>
<li>  IDE：Android Studio</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="具体步骤"><a href="#具体步骤" class="headerlink" title="具体步骤"></a>具体步骤</h2><h3 id="下载AS"><a href="#下载AS" class="headerlink" title="下载AS"></a>下载AS</h3><p>这一块很容易，直接在网上搜索就可以了</p>
<h3 id="安装gradle"><a href="#安装gradle" class="headerlink" title="安装gradle"></a>安装gradle</h3><p>由于国内的种种原因，无法高速下载gradle，所以我们可以手动安装gradle，首先，先在浏览器中下载gradle，下面是下载地址</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://services.gradle.org/distributions/">https://services.gradle.org/distributions/</a></p>
<p>然后放在AS创建的.gradle文件下的一串hash值命名的文件夹中，然后再打开AS的设置，选择通过指定路径配置。</p>
<h3 id="配置阿里的maven"><a href="#配置阿里的maven" class="headerlink" title="配置阿里的maven"></a>配置阿里的maven</h3><p>由于国内的种种特殊情况，在国内是没办法直接访问google的一些资源库的，但是在构建android app的时候需要下载各种gradle的依赖和库，所以这时候就要借助阿里的maven源，来帮我们构建项目。</p>
<p>这里我想强调一下，这里是一个大坑，因为现在网上百分之八十的阿里的maven源都是过时的，是不能用的，因为阿里已经抛弃的这个接口，我这里给出阿里的maven源地址：</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maven.aliyun.com/mvn/guide">https://maven.aliyun.com/mvn/guide</a></p>
<p>下面打开build.gradle这个文件，将里面的</p>
<p>google()<br>jcenter()</p>
<p>替换成：</p>
<p>maven <strong>{</strong> url ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/google&#39;">https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/google&#39;</a> <strong>}<br>**maven **{</strong> url ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/public&#39;">https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/public&#39;</a> <strong>}</strong></p>
<p>第一个源是阿里拉的谷歌的源，相当于google()</p>
<p>第二个相当于jcenter()</p>
<p>更改之后重新加载配置即可享受高速下载的乐趣！</p>
<h3 id="配置host"><a href="#配置host" class="headerlink" title="配置host"></a>配置host</h3><p>由于特殊原因，我们无法直接高速的获取google服务器上的sdk，所以我们必须要配置一下host来高速的访问谷歌的服务器，在这里的我想跟大家分享一下我遇到的坑。</p>
<p>网上的很多方法都是使用代理，但是，我发现很多代理都已经失效了，比如说mirrors.neusoft.edu.cn这个网站，我进去看过，实测并没有android的源，但是很多博客都是推荐的这个源，根本就是误人子弟！！所以，还是配置host是最佳方案！！下面废话不多说，直接来教你们怎么配置</p>
<ul>
<li>  首先打开hosts这个文件（路径：/etc/hosts），在打开的时候最好加一下sudo，获取一下最高的权限</li>
<li>  在文件中添加</li>
</ul>
<p>203.208.50.100  dl.google.com<br>203.208.40.37  dl.l.google.com</p>
<ul>
<li>  保存</li>
</ul>
<p>现在开始享受高速sdk和模拟器的下载吧！！</p>

<ul>
<li>  DBMS是位于用户与操作系统（OS）之间的一层数据管理软件。</li>
<li>  它为用户或应用程序提供访问数据库的方法，包括数据库的建立、查询、更新及各种数据控制。</li>
<li>  DBMS总是基于某种数据模型，可以分为层次型、网状型、关系型和面对对象型等（）</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="表和视图区别联系"><a href="#表和视图区别联系" class="headerlink" title="表和视图区别联系"></a>表和视图区别联系</h3><ul>
<li>  一个表可以是一个基本表，也可以是一个视图。</li>
<li>  基本表是实际存储在数据库中的表，视图是从基本表或者其他输入中导出的表。</li>
<li>  视图是一个虚表，它只在数据库中存储其定义，而不存放视图的数据。</li>
<li>  视图的数据仍存放在导出该视图的基本表中</li>
<li>  视图对应的于关系模型中的外模型，而基本表对应于关系模型的模式。</li>

<h2 id="题目"><a href="#题目" class="headerlink" title="题目"></a>题目</h2><p><strong>设计一个Fraction类的结构，该类表示一个可以单步前进的广义整数。该类有以下两个私有属性<br>int den; //单步前进的步进距离,也就是执行++运算后的增长量；<br>int num; //当前的整数值<br>设计和实现该类相应的结构函数，print函数，并重载它的前缀++运算符号和后缀++运算符号。<br>该类完成后，如下main()函数可以执行。<br>void main()<br>{<br>Fraction b(1,10),a(4,-8);<br>(a++).print();<br>a.print();<br>a = b++;<br>a.print();<br>a = ++b;<br>a.print();<br>}<br>执行的结果为<br>-8<br>-4<br>10<br>12</strong></p>
<h2 id="分析"><a href="#分析" class="headerlink" title="分析"></a>分析</h2><p>这道题主要考察的是前置++和后置++运算符的重载</p>
<p>Fraction&amp; operator++();      // 前置++<br>Fraction operator++(int);   // 后置++</p>
<p>后置++运算符必须要在后面加一个int形参，表示与前置++的区别，同时，由于是++运算，所以可以返回自身。前置++运算最好要返回引用，后置可以直接返回指针。</p>
